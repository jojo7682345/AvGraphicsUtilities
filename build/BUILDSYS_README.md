# The Builder
This system allows the project to be build 
without any external tools except a compiler. It is based on [nobuild](https://github.com/tsoding/nobuild). Although some alterations and extra functions were added.
The build system itself is found in the build.c file. 
The build.c file is written to simply function once. It has many memory leaks and breaks easily. It will have to be rewritten someday.
For now I wouln't touch it with even a 10 ft pole.
